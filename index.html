<!--
This is a long HTML comment added to increase the line count in .html files
so that GitHub’s Linguist language stats might show HTML as the primary language.

Explanation:
GitHub detects repository languages using a tool called Linguist.
It does not “run” your code but instead scans all files in your repo
and counts the number of lines written in each language type
(based on file extension and syntax rules).

For example:
- .cpp / .h files are counted as C++ code.
- .css files are counted as CSS code.
- .html files are counted as HTML code.
- Auto-generated files can be ignored (marked as vendored).

If your repo has more CSS lines than C++ or HTML,
GitHub will say the primary language is CSS.
That’s why, in this case, we are artificially adding a large HTML comment
to “boost” the line count for HTML.

This comment itself does not affect the actual webpage,
because HTML comments are ignored by browsers.
It only exists to change GitHub’s Linguist language statistics.

So if you see HTML suddenly becoming the primary language of this repository,
this giant comment is the reason why! -->
